GettingAndCleaningData
======================
This repository is for the Course Project for module 'Getting and cleaning data' in Coursera.org .

original data 
==========================
the Course Project uses set of sample data provided (available in https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ), specifically archives below:

- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt
- subject_test.txt

- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_train.txt

- features.txt (and description of each feature, contained in features_info.txt)
- activity_labels.txt

About assumptions made 
========================

- the y_test.txt and subject_test.txt contain the list of activity type and subject ID that correspond respectively to the row in x_test, i.e. the measures of row #1 in x_test, were generated by subject of row #1 in subject_test.txt and corresponds to the activity type y_test.txt.

steps performed for this course project
========================================

R script was generated and named 'run_analysis.R' to fulfill the steps required:

"You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

details of the steps to achieve results, which tidy data is generated and details of each variable name are contained in Codebook.md
